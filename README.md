Python Async Handler and Event Dispatcher

This package provides handling for events and asynchronous actions. Events are
hookable and fireable for any arbitrary object. The event emitter can be
interfaced into any python class or just used independently. Async is handled
via Promise objects and wrappers that allow flow to be collapsed back down
to one level.
